# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI Opponent

## Project Overview

This is a Python-based implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe with an AI opponent. The AI opponent uses a basic strategy to make decisions and provides an enjoyable challenge for players.

## Project Features

- Play against an AI opponent (X) that employs a simple decision-making algorithm.
- A simple menu system allows you to start the game or exit.
- The game board is displayed in the console, and players take turns marking their symbol (X or O).

## AI Strategy
The AI opponent employs a basic strategy:

- It prioritizes winning if it can make a move to form a winning combination.
- It blocks the player (you) from winning if you have a chance to win.
- If neither player is close to winning, it makes a random move.
